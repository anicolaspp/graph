# graph 

graph is a Connected Graph Generator tool that construct graphs of some given size. Notice that it generates all possible connected, undirected graphs of the given 
size, hence there is a large number of graphs being generated. The graphs are generated by size since G(n) can be generated from some G(n - 1).
